# You can provide a cif file with the coordinates of the atoms. Bragg reflections and available CTRs will be calculated based on the unit cell structure factor.

# This will override the settings in the .cif file, but the relative atomic coordinates will be preserved. 
# This is only optional, you can comment it out
